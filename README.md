Salt experiments


Each experiment to be done in own branch without merge to main branch, which serves mostly as a template.

This is a POC of setting up salt-ssh on a master and minions. 

Generates and places appropriate keys on master/minion, generates a roster file from minion info on auth or highstate, sets up salt-ssh package.
